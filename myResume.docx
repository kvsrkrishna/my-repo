Project: Netcontrol Track Outgate Management. 
Track Outage Management (TOM) is a tool to update train schedules based on issues that restrict traffic flow on the track network. Each outage is referred to as an incident. One incident can impact zero to many trains. Incidents can be created and edited by dispatchers, corridor managers using the user interface. External systems such as the Mechanical Defect Reporting (MDR), or General Track Scheduler (GTS) can create or edit incidents using services. An incident is entered for a particular location (called the impact location) and period of time (called the incident window). The key concepts associated with TOM are discussed below. 
Track Outgate Management has 3 types of incidents: Normal will search for trains traveling through the impact location during the specified window of time, and apply delays to the train schedules so that the train will not depart till the outage is resolved. Incidents are entered when they are currently occurring or recently happened. Basically allows the user to record the reason for an outage, but will not search for or impact any trains Maintenance of Way (MOW) a planned outage that can start in the past or the future. These are outages due to work on the track.
